Smart Car Parking System with Android Mobile Application allows you to monitor the slot status. However, the user cannot book a slot but this would be the future scope where the payment method could also be added. The hardware includes IR modules, servo motors, power supply and the ESP32 microcontroller with which the Wi-Fi is connected.  
Here, I have used Kodular for developing the Android mobile application which is then linked to the Google Firebase that stores the data continoulsy. As the data needs to be updated in respone with the sensors, we use Realtime Database here. 
The power supply for ESP32 and Servo are powered with 5v whereas the IR modules, 3.3v is enough for its functioning.
